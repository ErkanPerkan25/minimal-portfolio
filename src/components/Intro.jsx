            Hello there! My name is Eric, and I'm a senior at Lindenwood University studying in Computer Science.
            I work as a Lead Intern for Lindenwood's Baseball Data Science Team. During the time at Lindenwood I have 
            been a D1 student athlete in Swimming & Diving. During the time as an athlete I learned the importance of 
            time managment, language barriers, and teamwork. Currently I am looking for internship or a entry level job in 
            the field of Software Engineering.</p>
